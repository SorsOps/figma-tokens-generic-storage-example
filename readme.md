# Figma Tokens - Generic versioned storage

This is an example repo to self host your own generic versioned storage to interop with [Figma Tokens](https://www.figmatokens.com/).

Internally it uses SQLite as the storage as this is a toy example.

## Quickstart

```sh
npm ci 
npm run start
```

This should expose a service running on port `8000` by default.
